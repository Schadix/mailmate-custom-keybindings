# mailmate-custom-keybindings
based on the gmail keybindings that come with MailMate, but extended a little bit (e. g. selectors for Outlines)

file location: ~/Library/Application\ Support/MailMate/Resources/KeyBindings/gmail-extended.plist

These are the 2 main doc links from MailMate:
* https://manual.mailmate-app.com/key_binding_selectors
* https://manual.mailmate-app.com/custom_key_bindings

These are 2 good posts and setups for MailMate. I am only starting to use it more and love it.
